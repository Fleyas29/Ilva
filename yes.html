        <p>
            I am so happy to have met you, and I love everything about you. From the very first moments of us talking, I fell in love with you. I don't believe I will ever find another girl like you. You are the most perfect girl ever. You are funny, beautiful, and hot. You have the most calming voice, and I love to talk to you and listen to your voice. I love everything about my little cute princess. I hope we stay together forever, and I will fight for it to happen. All the plans we made are not just plans, we are going to make them real. With me, you are going to be the happiest girl in the world.(Ill fuck you hard) I love that you are shy. I love everything you do for me and how you do it. You are my perfect girl and always will be.
